### Objective

Your assignment is to implement a productstore REST API using Java and Ecosystem Spring.

### Brief

Mike wants to build a marketplace oneline that allows him and his friends to self-publish their products and sell them. 


### Tasks

-   Implement assignment using:
    -   Language: **Java**
    -   Framework: **Ecosystem Spring( framework, springboot, data, security, mvc etc)**
-   Implement a custom user model with fields: name, pseudonym
-   Implement a product model with fields: title, description, owner (your custom user model), product_image(url) and price
    -   Choose the data type for each field that makes the most sense
-   Provide endpoints to authenticate with the API using username, password and return a JWT
-   Implement REST endpoints for the product resource
    -   get the all products according to the title ( list/detail in json )
		-	No authentication required
		-   Make the List resource searchable with query parameters ( optional, it's a bonus )
	-	publish a product
		-	authentication required
	-	update a product 
		-	authentication required
	-	unpublish a product according to the id of the product
		-	authentication required and each user can only unpublish his own products
-   Implement API tests for all endpoints


### Evaluation Criteria

-   **Java** best practices
-   If you are using a framework make sure best practices are followed for models, configuration and tests
-   Write API tests for all implemented endpoints
